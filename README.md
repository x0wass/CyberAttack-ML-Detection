# ðŸ’» CyberAttack-ML-Detection

This repository encapsulates my personal journey into the world of cybersecurity, using machine learning as a tool to detect and understand various cyber threats. As I navigate through different types of cyber attacks, from DDoS to malware and more, I document my learning process, challenges, and insights here.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights:

* Exploring Attack Vectors: My exploration into different cyber threats, each presenting its unique challenges and learning opportunities.
* Hands-on Data Analysis: As I dissect datasets, I visualize and analyze patterns, understanding the digital footprints of cyber threats.
* Feature Engineering: My attempts to refine and process data, making it suitable for effective machine learning models.
* Diving into Model Training: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to detect specific cyber threats.
* Model Evaluation: My learning curve on understanding how well my models perform and iterating for improvement.

##  ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
This repository is a reflection of my personal quest to blend the domains of cybersecurity and machine learning. It's a space where I document my learnings, mistakes, and achievements, hoping that this might guide or inspire others on a similar journey.
